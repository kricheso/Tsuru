Tsuru is an in-development iPhone/iPad application that will become avaliable to the App Store for free. The app makes learning Japanese extremely easy and efficient. Tsuru uses a SRS algorithm called [Leitner's System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) to test you only on the Japanese vocabulary that you are about to forget. This method drastically optimizes studying by helping learners skip the material he or she can already reliably recall. Other applications like Anki, Cleverdeck, and Flashcards Deluxe successfully utilize this method. However, these applications are not gear towards Japanese and does not have the additional features that could enchance learning. Tsuru specializes in Kanji and will test you on your handwritting along with your vocabulary. In addition, Tsuru is fun and will keep learners motivated with the level system that is implementent in the app!
